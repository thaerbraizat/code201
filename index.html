            <strong>Wraith King</strong> is a melee strength hero, as well as a carry and tank, capable of both dealing and taking plenty of damage.
            his infamous Reincarnation allows the Wraith King to rise again after death, acting like an Aegis of the Immortal,
            making him especially difficult to kill. But if left alive,
            the Wraith King can wreak havoc upon his enemies;
            his Wraithfire Blast provides reliable damage and a stun on a short cooldown,
            Vampiric Spirit grants himself sizeable lifesteal and passively helps make short work of foes,
            while its active allows for quick pushing.

            <strong>Juggernaut</strong> is a melee agility hero whose abilities allow him to sprint into battle and recklessly devastate enemies in an impenetrable flurry of blades.
            His abilities grant invulnerability and spell immunity, turning him into an unstoppable force on a hairpin.
            Juggernaut is strong both offensively and defensively, and deals heavy damage both physical and magical with his Blade Fury and Omnislash ultimate,
            but he possesses below average strength and intelligence attributes,
            he cannot charge into forces without restraint until farmed and is usually played as a carry.

           <strong>Phantom Lancer</strong> is a melee agility hero who can fill the role of carry and pusher because of his ability to generate an army of illusions in a matter of seconds.
            He requires deep cunning, positioning, and most importantly, great micromanagement as his illusions might just get in the way rather than help the situation if not
            utilized correctly.Many of his abilities help him in his creation of images, allowing him to always have a companion.

            and leaps to the treetops to have advantage over his foes with Tree Dance.
